# Auto-Parcel

A fast annotation processor to make your objects `Parcelable` without
writing any of the boilerplate.

The project is inspired in [auto-value-parcel](https://github.com/rharter/auto-value-parcel/) 
extension and some of the code and utils are borrowed from it.

## Background

[Parcelable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html) classes
are great to put your objects into a [Bundle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html) 
and/or send them across an [Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html).
But there is a non-negligible boilerplate one has to write to make a class
parcelable and, let's be clear, nobody should ever need to write this code.
It is uninteresting code and highly prone to error.

There are a number of libraries out there to make your life simpler when
using parcelables. Some create [wrappers](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler) around your object to parcel/unparcel,
some others generate code.
This is yet-another-parcelable-library that uses Android Studio
annotation processors to generate your parcelable classes at compile time.

## Installation
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/aitorvs/auto-parcel.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#aitorvs/auto-parcel)

### Repository

Add the following repo to your `app/build.gradle`

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

### Dependencies

Add the following to gradle dependencies:

```gradle
dependencies {
    
    //... other dependencies here
    
    provided 'com.github.aitorvs.auto-parcel:library:0.1.0-rc1'
    apt 'com.github.aitorvs.auto-parcel:compiler:0.1.0-rc1'
}
```

The annotation processor requires [android-apt](https://bitbucket.org/hvisser/android-apt) plugin.

## Usage

The use of the library is very simple. 
Just create an abstract `Parcelable`-to-be class, annotate it with `@AutoParcel` and 
it will do the rest.

```java
import com.aitorvs.autoparcel.AutoParcel;

@AutoParcel
public abstract class Person {
    @Nullable
    public String name;
    public int age;

    public static Person create(@NonNull String name, int age) {
        return new AutoParcel_Person(name, age);
    }
}
```

AutoParcel will generate a parcelable class that extends from the abstract
class you created. The generated class name follows the convention `AutoParcel_<YouClassName>`.

You will need to add a convenience builder method (e.g. `creator`) that 
calls the generated class constructor and that is all there is to it. 

You are ready now to e.g. send an instance of `Person` across an intent

```
intent.putExtra(EXTRA_PERSON, (Parcelable) person);
```

To avoid the need to cast `Person` to `(Parcelable)` just add `implements Parcelable` 
to your abstract class definition. AutoParcel will detect it and do the rest anyway.

```
@AutoParcel
public abstract class Person implements Parcelable {...}
```

It is important to note that AutoParcel errors out when **private** fields are found, because
they are not accessible from the generated class. Use either `protected` or `public` instead.

## Parcel Adapters

AutoParcel supports all types supported by [Parcel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html)
with the exception of `Map` -- why? read [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html). 

At times you will also need to parcel more complex types. For that, use `ParcelAdapter`s.
Let's see an example for a `Date` parcel adapter.

```java
import android.os.Parcel;
import com.aitorvs.autoparcel.ParcelTypeAdapter;
import java.util.Date;

class DateTypeAdapter implements ParcelTypeAdapter<Date> {
    @Override
    public Date fromParcel(Parcel in) {
        return new Date(in.readLong());
    }

    @Override
    public void toParcel(Date value, Parcel dest) {
        dest.writeLong(value.getTime());
    }
}
```

Now you can use your adapter into your classes.

```java
import com.aitorvs.autoparcel.AutoParcel;

@AutoParcel
public abstract class Person {
    @Nullable
    public String name;
    @ParcelAdapter(DateTypeAdapter.class)
    public Date birthday;
    public int age;

    public static Person create(@NonNull String name, @NonNull Date birthday, int age) {
        return new AutoParcel_Person(name, birthday, age);
    }
}
```

Parcel adapters are optional and the require the `ParcelTypeAdapter` runtime component.
To use them just add to your gradle the following dependency.

```
compile 'com.github.aitorvs.auto-parcel:adapter:0.1.0-rc1'
```

## Pitfalls

- Bootstrap is somehow annoying because when typing your first `AutoParcel_Foo` 
it will turn red in the IDE until the first build is performed.
- Order of the constructor `AutoParcel_Foo` parameters is important and 
according to their appearance in the source file.
